Merge Tool Selector
===================

Most source control systems right now do not let you filter or select
different merge/diff tools based on the file extensions.

This tool is designed to mitigate that problem.


Currently it's almost useless unless you only use Beyond Compare 3
and/or Semantic Merge in their default install locations on Windows.

Consider it pre-alpha, and I'm uploading here as a storage area while
I build it.
